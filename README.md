Hands on labs for LNaT course

In order to consume the lab environment scripts in this repo, the host must have installed:
- QEMU/KVM virtualization (5.1.0)
- Terraform (0.13.5) with the libvirt plugin(0.6.2)
- Ansible (2.9.15)

Chapter 5 - Routing
Chapter 6 - Domain Name Service (DNS)
Chapter 7 - Firewalls (iptables and firewalld)
Chapter 8 - Connection Troubleshooting
Chapter 9 - Port Forwarding
Chapter 10 - SSH Tunneling
Chapter 11 - Proxy Servers (Squid)
Chapter 12 - Load Balancing (HAProxy and Nginx)

Chapters 1 through 3 are conceptual and don't have any practical exercises.
Chapter 4 was done in a graphical environment and I didn't bother to create scripts for it.
